      <p>I founded Tactopus while in design school, with a mission to address the lack of access to learning material for children with disabilities.
      <br>Thanks to the support of many individuals and organisations, we are now a fully-operational team of ten, serving schools, resource centres, parents and children with disabilities all over the world.<br> A few of the key products produced at Tactopus:</p>
