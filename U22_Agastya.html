      <h3> Residency at Agastya Foundation</h3>
      <p>A few hours away from the big, noisy city of Bangalore, there's a small village of quiet curiosity, that sometimes gets quite loud with the voices of excited children as they explore life-size models and interactive science experiments. The drab drawings in their textbooks were coming alive and finally making sense in this campus. This is <a href="https://www.agastya.org/" target="_blank">Agastya Foundation</a>'s Kuppam Campus. <br>When I got the opportunity to do a short residency there upon Prof. Alka Hingorani's suggestion, I couldn't have foreseen how the environment would affect my creative process. </p>
      <img src="res/U22_Agastya/ch_2.jpg">
      <p>I was to spend two weeks here, but in a well-equipped innovation centre, and work on the following brief: <br> To humanise models, to make the experiences more memorable, relatable and easy to use.<br><br>
      After much pondering, I realised that the experiences were not quite like creating lesson plans. Designing exhibits at Agastya is a lot like blurb writing, or book-cover design. Picking the best quotes, reviews, and descriptions to put on the cover, to get even a passing reader hooked enough that they go back and read the whole book.
      <br> <br>The first few days, I spent simply assimiliating what Agastya was all about. Then I shortlisted a few topics, and zeroed in on optics. Targeting students of class 6-8, I designed a playful way to experience properties of light, in a tangible, hands on way.<br> <br>Videos of final design in use, followed by design process images below.</p>

      <p>Turns out, sunlight is more fun than any artificial light source:</p>

      <p>If I could post-mortem break this down into essential components, it would be:<br>
      - a contained environment that can be manipulated, and the corelation and effects observeable,<br>
      - a clear goal or objective,<br>
      - the path to achieve the goal that involves manipulating parameters,<br>
      - the observation of effects lead to learning, <br>
      - opportunity to develop an intimate, comfortable understanding of the material's properties.<br>
      - materials being explored here: light, reflective surfaces, opaque material, scattering effect upon multiple reflections.<br>

      <p>There were many installations and equipment used in capus to familiarise students with perperties of light, this one used lenses to focus light on specific targets. It was a bit of a challenge because the targets weren't on the same level plane.</p>

      <p>Sketching, writing: part of the design process.<br> Objective was to make this more fun, playful, memorable, relatable, or as the founder, Mr. Ramji Raghavan put it - more human.</p>

      <p>Luckily, the laser cutting machine was functional that week, and all the material i needed were available: MDF, mirror acrylic, a laser pen.  The only thing I couldn't find- sand for the hourlgass.</p>
