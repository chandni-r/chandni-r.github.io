        <p class="resume-item-description"> <a href="https://tactopus.com" target="_blank">  Tactopus</a> is an inclusive education technology company I founded while in design school. Having witnessed that access to learning was severely limited for children with vision loss, I almost instantly saw a huge opportunity to develop tech-enabled tools to make learning more accessible and fun.
        <br><br>
        Tactopus is now a team of ten, with products in  50+ schools and resource centres for children with disabilities, and customers in 7 countries.
        <br><br>
        I’ve done what founders typically do- a little and lot of nearly everything. That includes design, prototyping, user-testing, service design, interaction design, unity development, web development, design for manufacturing, illustrations,  product-market fit, business development, marketing, supply chain, sales, distributor deals, fund-raising, stakeholder management, hiring, and organisation design. <br><br>

I found her to be very bright, a quick learner, one with a lot of energy and commitment and one that could work with very little supervision as result, in a particularly stressful time, we were very happy having her in the team, as she was productive virtually from day one, as she is one who is able to hit the road running. She will be a great asset to any team that she joins."

            <p class="test-title">Head of Sales at yepme.com, Ex - Senior Management at Titan Company Ltd.</p>
            <p class="test-text">"Chandni was my colleague in Titan, as a retail store designer, reporting to me when as Head – Retail Projects, I was heading Titan’s retail projects group, which also includes Titan’s retail design team.   During this tenure I worked closely <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> with Chandni and thus had an opportunity to deeply understand her both professionally and personally. <br>
            Chandni is creative, adaptable, passionate and a bright individual with an excellent eye for detail and design. She has vast experience designing stores for an extensive portfolio of Titan’s brands, product categories, product designs and styles – watches, sports watches, jewelry, eye wear and a wide variety of store formats – Titan’s store brands – HELIOS and ZOYA and flagship stores, kiosks etc.  '
            <br>
            She has excellent interpersonal skills to work with the brand teams, co-Designers, and other colleagues in the Retail Projects division, vendors and external store designers on contract, to achieve a certain objective on time and with excellence.
            <br>
            Chandni’s interests go beyond just designing a store; she is involved in the roll outs of all her assigned stores from construction drawings and the get-go to the completion of a project and its grand opening. She is keenly monitors every step of the progress of a store helping the execution team solve construction glitches and to ensure store completion on-time, on-target and on-budget.  Her greatest strength is her ability to research to solve problematic situations or generate new ideas or to evolve a design based on suggested concepts or based on emerging store designs in general.
            <br>
            Chandni’s design suggestions were always one of providing something unique, something that enables customers to interact with the brand on a multi-sensory level and something that generates an emotional response and attracts attention and provides the best and most memorable shopping experience - ever.
            <br>
            In a challenging fast paced retail environment Chandni has assisted various brand teams in successfully and creatively reaching the brands’ customers through design solutions that are contemporary and are experiential expressions of the brands’ or product categories’ – target market, marketing strategy, brand positioning and brand identity.
            <br>
            I wish her all the best in all endeavours.</span>
