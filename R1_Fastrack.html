      <h3> Project Management for Fastrack New Retail Identity </h3>
      <p>My first assignment upon joining Titan Company, was to work with Lotus Design.<br> I was responsible for working with the project team on site, fittings manufactuing vendors, brand marketing teams and the architects. <br> Sourcing material for this quirky and irreverent store was a challenge but also fun.
      <br> It was also a good way to learn all about retail projects, it was a little like being pushed into the deep end of the pool.</p>

      <p>Learning: project management, exposure to returns on investment, collaboration, working with 100+ individual contributors, vendors, contractors, delivering project on schedule (of 90 days), managing conflicts, offering practical decision making information to design and brand teams based on project progress, cost management. <br> <br>Also personal stress management, leadership development with a team that was culturally and economically diverse, learnt to speak Hindi more fluently during this time, as I had to work with a largely hindi-speaking workforce on site. I was put on this project and guided by Mr. Kulothungan, senior management who was ex-CRPF, with a career in sales. He had only veteran-standard expectations from my work and I learnt to imbibe that in my process.</p>
