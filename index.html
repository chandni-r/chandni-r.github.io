    <h1> Chandni Rajendran </h1>
    <p> I'm an experience designer, who enjoys teaching computers to play better with human beings</p>
    <p> Things I can do, which sound like fun: design, sketch, user experience design, web design, code to prototype, virtual and augmented reality, embodied interactions, lerning design, game design, design of play, simple animations, business plans, investment and grant pitches, team building, finding exciting ideas and problems to solve, and then getting everybody else in the room excited about building creative solutions, enabling thinking, enabling people to see information from different perspectives, making complex systems a little more transparent and easy to understand. </p>
    <p> Some of the things I do that don't sound like fun, but are pretty exiting: problem framing, working through complex information and processes, thinking through user journeys, user testing, designing user flows, heuristically analysing products and experiences, iterating and completely rethinking concepts, toying with mental models, reimagining a world enhanced by technology in an equitable, healthy and nurturing way for everybody. I've also found that I enjoy keeping teams motivated, helping everybody keep sight of the big picture, helping organise/manage team's time, excitement, energy, anxieties, fears and creative and collaborative energies. </p>
    <p> Things that I care about: social inclusion, equal access to opportunities, dismantling institutional, structural and social inequalities. It excites me most to see technology empowering people to do things that they've been historically held back from.</p>
