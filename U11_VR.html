      <h3> Virtual Reality Game: Skywalk </h3>
      <p>Course: Design for Virtual Reality <br>
      Course Guide: Prof. Jayesh Pillai<br>
      Team: Ajinkya More, Chandni Rajendran<br>
      Brief: Design a game or interactive experience using virtual reality as a medium.
      </p>
      <p> Concept: This is a game located in an arbitrary, space like scenario, except the gravitational forces here are exactly as one would find on earth. (#mygamemyrules)
      </p>
      <img class="smaller-img" src="res/U11_VR/ch_1.jpg">
      <p>When the game starts, the player finds themselves looking at a magical portal in the distance, and a few stepping stones leading up to it. One moves forward by selecting a stepping stone, by gazing at it. The selection button on Google Cardboard was glitchy, so we used just gaze-selection.
      <br>
      The catch, however, is that this isn't an easy walk through. There are giant bars swinging across these stepping stones. It would be wise to avoid getting hit by them, and thrown off course.</p>

      <p>Here's a 2D screedgrab of the game experience:</p>
      <!-- <img class="small-img" src="res/U11_VR/ch_2.jpg"> -->
      <iframe class="videos" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6NtzQaHGKo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>




      <p>Highlights, things we throughly enjoyed designing:
        <li><b>Losing this game is fun.</b> Did you see what happens when you get hit by one of the swinging bars? We tried different ways for the player to experience that hit, including one where the player spins away, out of control, into space. This caused a lot of discomfort to test-players, and caused confusion while resuming play, so we had to let it go.
        <br> The final game has an interesting sense of being hit, topping, and retreating back to the starting point without losing orientation. This effect is achieved by the use of game sounds and the player suddenly losing control of the view, and being dragged back to the start line.
        <br>
        <br> Users who tested this would physically cringe at this point. It was so easy to go overboard and make it more dramatic, but we had to find the right balance to make it a pleasant-unpleasant experience.</li>

        <li><b>Design of the swinging bars:</b> These were conceptualised as heavy hammers-like, large objects. They needed to be threatening, so it's clear that they should be avoided. The slight taper, adding more (virtual) weight to the bottom, simulating the swing of a pendulum, the glowing strips along the side, all contribute to the final effect created.<br> They are also much larger than the player's perceived human scale, making it necessary for the player to turn around in different directions to track the bars, using all the features of VR that make it so immersive and engaging.</li>

      <p>
        <li><b>Design of the portal.</b> A simple circular portal with a glowing plasma like orb. The stepping stones leading up to this bright target makes it clear what the objective of the game is.</li>

        <li><b>Levelling up.</b> Once you reach this portal, you move to the next level, and the transition for this was a lot of fun to experiment with. It's at 1:02 in the video. Could have been smoother.  </li>

        <li><b>Game Music:</b> Immensely enjoyable to create visceral experienes using the right sound effects and music. </li>

        <li><b>Unity Game Engine!</b> Also a lot of fun to learn to develop games in Unity using C# (no prior exposure) and create this game in less than 7 days.  </li>
