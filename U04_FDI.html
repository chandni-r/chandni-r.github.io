      <h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
      <p>Course: Information Design<br>
      Course guide: Prof. Venkatesh Rajamanickam<br>
      Brief: Pick an area of data related to the Indian economy, government. Collect, process, play with the data, look for interesting insights that can be made apparent by visualising the data. Represent it visually for an article to appear on the 3rd page of the daily news.

      <p>Exhibit B, one of the earlier drafts that annoyed the course guide considerably. This is what design school was about- working through iterations with a critical peer group and faculty. Hopefully one gets better through this process.</p>

      <p>I'm not too happy with the final work (first image) either, and would have loved to linger on this, redo it endlessly until it's "perfect", but have to accept that this exercise made me a better designer in a few areas, and that was the primary purpose.</p>
