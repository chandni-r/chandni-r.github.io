    <h4 class="page-description">  Design of a text-input system that uses the edges of a smartphone as tangible markers, making it easy for people with vision loss to type on touch screen phones.<br> <br> Finalist at Student Design Competition, CHI 2016, San Jose. <br>  <br>

      <p> I was introduced to accessibility in HCI when I met a colleague who was blind since birth. When I spent more time with him, I noticed that of all the accessibility gestures he used on his phone, he was most confident with the two finger swipe down from the top - to pull down the notifications bar.</p>

      <p>Clearly, having a tangible edge as a marker made the action considerably easier. That sparked the idea to explore if more of the gestures could leverage the sides of the phone. In this project, I've looked at the use of phone edges in typing.</p>

      <p>Over the winter break of 2015, I prototyped this keyboard (great opportunity to learn to develop on android) and also sent it as an entry to the CHI student design competition. The brief that year was about assistive technology and this project was a good fit. This is the poster presented at the conference:</p>

      <p>Once we got shortlisted to the top 15, we also got the Gary Marsden Student Travel Grant that enabled us to travel to San Jose to present at the conference.<br>
      At the conference, we presented the poster, and made it to the top four teams that got to present to a larger audience at the conference. Video below:</p>

      <p>Prototype: creating a softkeyboard on android, thinking through this absolutely new (to me) information structure and way of telling computers how to behave.</p>
