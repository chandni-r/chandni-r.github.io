        <p> About a decade back, I studied architecture. I was really interested in heritage conservation and urban design. Then I designed retail stores for a jewellery brand for a few years. My work hovered somewhere between <i>average</i> to <i>mildly remarkable</i>. </p>
        <p><b> But when I discovered human computer interaction design, I knew I'd come home.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        I went on to study HCI at IIT Bombay (2015-17), where I had the chance to indulge the restless tinkerer, the intuitive problem solver, and the curious collaborator in me.
        </p>
        <p>
        Right now, I lead <a href="https://tactopus.com" target="_blank">Tactopus</a>, a small ed-tech startup with big goals- to create accessible and inclusive learning aids for children with vision impairment. We are a team of 10, funded by Social Alpha and IDFC FIRST Bank, and our products are in 300+ schools, libraries, resource centres and homes - helping children learn through multi-sensory play.
        </p>
        <p>
        I founded Tactopus during my masters program in HCI, where it was effectively me and a wooden contraption powered by Processing (P5), with promise of future potential to dazzle. With support, recognition and funding, we have been able to find a product-market fit, and establish steady revenue streams. Now, it is an inspiring, able, driven, team who are actively developing innovative products, working closely with educators and beneficiaries, redefining what learning can be, for children with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
        The organisation is growing steadily, and has solid leadership to take it forward. After having spent 4 years being highly focused on Tactopus, I'm ready to explore other challenges, find my next set of problems to work on.
        </p>
        <p>
        The best way to get to know me is to talk to me, of course, but this website has some of my work you can go through.
